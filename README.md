md-typescript is an attempt to build TypeScript language binding for
MonoDevelop, based on md-haxebinding.
https://github.com/jgranick/md-haxebinding

So far it is based on master monodevelop and NRefactory used in it.

It is by no means working yet.

It will use either console node.js server or embedded Jurassic executable
to interoperate with typescriptService.js to retrieve code completion
information and so on.
